        <p>The naval Battle of Lagos took place between a British fleet commanded by Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Boscawen">Edward Boscawen</a> and a French fleet under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_de_La_Clue-Sabran">Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran</a> over two days in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. They fought south west of the Gulf of Cádiz on 18 August and to the east of the small Portuguese port of Lagos, after which the battle is named, on 19 August.

            La Clue was attempting to evade Boscawen and bring the French Mediterranean Fleet into the Atlantic, avoiding battle if possible; he was then under orders to sail for the West Indies. Boscawen was under orders to prevent a French breakout into the Atlantic, and to pursue and fight the French if they did. During the evening of 17 August the French fleet successfully passed through the Strait of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, but was sighted by a British ship shortly after it entered the Atlantic.</p>

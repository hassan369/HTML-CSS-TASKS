    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <p>There are over 500 million domestic cats in the world. Cats and humans have been associated for nearly 10000 years. Cats conserve energy by sleeping for an average of 13 to14 hours a day. Cats have flexible bodies and teeth adapted for hunting small animals such as mice and rats.</p>
